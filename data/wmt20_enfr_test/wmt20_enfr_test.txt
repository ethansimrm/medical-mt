doc100	1	Idiopathic intracranial hypertension and bariatric surgery: a systematic review
doc100	2	Background
doc100	3	Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare condition typically affecting women with obesity who are of child-bearing age.
doc100	4	Patients commonly present with headaches, visual disturbances, pulsatile tinnitus and papilledema.
doc100	5	The association between IIH and obesity has been well established in the literature, suggesting that weight loss may contribute to improving IIH.
doc100	6	For patients with severe obesity for whom conservative management is not successful, bariatric surgery is an effective modality for weight loss.
doc100	7	We aimed to systematically review the literature to determine the efficacy of bariatric surgery in the treatment of IIH
doc100	8	Methods
doc100	9	We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science (limited to studies in humans published in English between January 1946 and July 2015).
doc100	10	Results
doc100	11	Twelve primary studies (n = 39 patients) were included in the systematic review.
doc100	12	All patients had a preoperative diagnosis of IIH.
doc100	13	Preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 47.4 ± 3.6 kg/m2; BMI improved to 33.7 ± 2.1 kg/2 and 33.9 ± 11.6 kg/2 at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, respectively.
doc100	14	Lumbar puncture opening pressures decreased from 34.4 ± 6.9 cm H2O to 14.0 ± 3.6 cm H2O after surgery.
doc100	15	Common symptoms of IIH improved after bariatric surgery: headaches (100% preoperatively v. 10% postoperatively), visual complaints (62% v. 44%), tinnitus (56% v. 3%) and papilledema (62% v. 8%).
doc100	16	Conclusion
doc100	17	Bariatric surgery appears to lead to considerable improvement in IIH.
doc100	18	Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is not a well-publicized comorbidity of obesity, but its presence may be considered as an indication for bariatric surgery.
doc51	1	Clinical outcomes of single-incision robotic cholecystectomy versus conventional 3-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy
doc51	2	Background
doc51	3	Few studies have compared the surgical results of single-incision robotic cholecystectomy (SIRC) with those of conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC).
doc51	4	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative clinical efficacy of SIRC by comparing the number of postoperative days, pain level and complications between the 2 surgical methods.
doc51	5	Methods
doc51	6	We retrospectively collected demographic, perioperative and postoperative data for all patients who underwent SIRC or CLC performed by a single surgeon from June 2016 to May 2017.
doc51	7	Operative time was recorded, divided into anesthesia time, docking time, console time and total operation time.
doc51	8	Postoperative pain was measured with the Numerical Pain Rating Scale.
doc51	9	Results
doc51	10	A total of 121 patients underwent cholecystectomy during the study period, of whom 61 had SIRC and 60 had CLC.
doc51	11	The mean total operation time of SIRC and CLC was 93.52 (SD 20.27) minutes and 37.67 (SD 19.73) minutes, respectively (p < 0.001).
doc51	12	The total operation time excluding console time of SIRC was significantly longer than that of CLC (82.77 [SD 18.27] min v. 37.67 [SD 19.73] min) (p < 0.001).
doc51	13	The mean Numerical Pain Rating Scale score was 4.73 (SD 1.23) (SIRC: 4.75 [SD 1.24]; CLC: 4.70 [SD 1.22]) (p = 0.8) within 1 hour after the operation; scores after 6 hours and 1 day decreased in a similar manner in the 2 groups (p = 0.1).
doc51	14	Conclusion
doc51	15	Postoperative pain, use of an additional port, complication rates, operation time and cost of SIRC were similar to or greater than those of CLC.
doc51	16	Large randomized controlled trials are needed to examine the true benefits of SIRC.
doc52	1	Understanding the patellofemoral joint in total knee arthroplasty
doc52	2	Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most successful procedures in orthopedic surgery.
doc52	3	Nevertheless, postoperative patellofemoral complications remain a challenging problem, affecting a substantial proportion of patients.
doc52	4	Complications involving the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) can occur in both resurfaced and nonresurfaced patellae.
doc52	5	Types of PFJ complications include anterior knee pain, maltracking, fracture, avascular necrosis and patellar clunk.
doc52	6	The causes of patellofemoral complications can be categorized into patient-, surgeon- and implant-related factors.
doc52	7	Patient characteristics such as female sex, young age, depression and increased body mass index have been linked with increased complications.
doc52	8	Important technical considerations to avoid complications include achieving appropriate rotational alignment of the femoral and tibial components, maintaining joint line height, medializing the patellar button and avoiding “overstuffing” the PFJ.
doc52	9	Component design features such as conformity, shape and depth of the femoral trochlea have also been shown to be important.
doc52	10	Although the cause of patellofemoral complications after TKA may sometimes be unknown, it remains important to minimize errors that can lead to these complications.
doc53	1	Study protocol for promoting physical activity among women based on the MAPP process.
doc53	2	Background
doc53	3	The participation of all stakeholders is necessary when a community-based intervention is designed.
doc53	4	For running a practical intervention, it is necessary to have a framework to design the programme while considering all stages of planning, implementation and evaluation.
doc53	5	Aims
doc53	6	To describe a study protocol based on the MAPP process (Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships) for promoting physical activity (PA).
doc53	7	Methods
doc53	8	This protocol is implemented in 6 distinct phases.
doc53	9	The goal of the first and second phase is to organize the programme and increase participation, and to determine the vision of the programme, respectively.
doc53	10	The third phase provides a comprehensive picture of a community.
doc53	11	The fourth and fifth phases identify strategies for the programme.
doc53	12	The sixth phase is about the action cycle.
doc53	13	Conclusion
doc53	14	The framework considers all factors on PA improvement and, consequently, results in a culture-based programme for women.
doc54	1	Preconceptional factors associated with haemoglobin concentration in early pregnancy: a community-based cohort study in rural northeastern Tanzania.
doc54	2	OBJECTIVE
doc54	3	Maternal anaemia in early pregnancy is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes.
doc54	4	Furthermore, preconceptional health can influence the health during pregnancy.
doc54	5	The aim of this study was to investigate which preconceptional factors were associated with haemoglobin (Hb) concentration in early pregnancy.
doc54	7	In Tanzania, 226 women were followed at preconception and during early pregnancy.
doc54	8	Red blood cell (RBC) morphology, serum micronutrient concentration, demographic characteristics and health status were assessed in preconception and in early pregnancy.
doc54	9	The association between preconceptional factors and Hb concentration in early pregnancy was investigated using simple and multiple linear regression analyses stratified by preconceptional anaemia status.
doc54	10	RESULTS
doc54	11	Mean Hb was 123 and 119 g/l before conception and during early pregnancy (median gestational age 53 days) respectively.
doc54	12	Preconceptional mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) (adjusted coefficient (AC) 0.35 95% CI 0.9-0.61) and preconceptional Hb concentration (AC 0.45 95% CI 0.36-0.54) were positively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration, whereas preconceptional microcytic hypochromic RBC morphology (AC -6.00 95% CI -9.56 to -2.44) was negatively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration.
doc54	13	In addition, treatment of preconceptional malaria was positively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration (AC 6.45 95% CI 0.74-12.2) among women with preconceptional anaemia.
doc54	14	In contrast, among preconceptional non-anaemic women, only preconceptional Hb concentration and medium socio-economic status was positively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration.
doc54	15	CONCLUSIONS
doc54	16	Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and Hb measurements in preconception can help to detect women at increased risk of low Hb concentration in early pregnancy.
doc55	1	Effect of a maternal and newborn health system quality improvement project on the use of facilities for childbirth: a cluster-randomised study in rural Tanzania.
doc55	2	OBJECTIVES
doc55	3	Reduction in maternal and newborn mortality requires that women deliver in high quality health facilities.
doc55	4	However, many facilities provide sub-optimal quality of care, which may be a reason for less than universal facility utilisation.
doc55	5	We assessed the impact of a quality improvement project on facility utilisation for childbirth.
doc55	6	METHODS
doc55	7	In this cluster-randomised experiment in four rural districts in Tanzania, 12 primary care clinics and their catchment areas received a quality improvement intervention consisting of in-service training, mentoring and supportive supervision, infrastructure support, and peer outreach, while 12 facilities and their catchment areas functioned as controls.
doc55	8	We conducted a census of all deliveries within the catchment area and used difference-in-differences analysis to determine the intervention's effect on facility utilisation for childbirth.
doc55	9	We conducted a secondary analysis of utilisation among women whose prior delivery was at home.
doc55	10	We further investigated mechanisms for increased facility utilisation.
doc55	11	RESULTS
doc55	12	The intervention led to an increase in facility births of 6.7 percentage points from a baseline of 72% (95% Confidence Interval: 0.6, 12.8).
doc55	13	The intervention increased facility delivery among women with past home deliveries by 18.3 percentage points (95% CI: 10.1, 26.6).
doc55	14	Antenatal quality increased in intervention facilities with providers performing an additional 0.5 actions across the full population and 0.8 actions for the home delivery subgroup.
doc55	15	CONCLUSIONS
doc55	16	We attribute the increased use of facilities to better antenatal quality.
doc55	17	This increased utilisation would lead to lower maternal mortality only in the presence of improvement in care quality.
doc56	1	Chiropractic conservatism and the ability to determine contra-indications, non-indications, and indications to chiropractic care: a cross-sectional survey of chiropractic students.
doc56	2	Background
doc56	3	While there is a broad spectrum of practice within chiropractic two sub-types can be identified, those who focus on musculoskeletal problems and those who treat also non-musculoskeletal problems.
doc56	4	The latter group may adhere to the old conservative 'subluxation' model.
doc56	5	The main goal of this study is to determine if chiropractic students with such conservative opinions are likely to have a different approach to determine contra-indications, non-indications and indications to chiropractic treatment versus those without such opinions.
doc56	6	Method
doc56	7	An anonymous and voluntary survey on 3rd to 6th year French chiropractic students was conducted between November 2017 and January 2018.
doc56	8	Level of chiropractic conservatism (10 items) and the ability to determine contra-indications (2 cases), non-indications (4 cases) and indications (3 cases) were evaluated through a questionnaire.
doc56	9	Answers to these cases were dichotomized into 'appropriate' and 'inappropriate' answers, as defined by previous research teams and the present team.
doc56	10	The level of conservatism was classified into four groups, 'group 4' corresponding to the highest score.
doc56	11	Descriptive data are provided, and bi- and multivariate analyses were performed through logistic regression to test the associations between the level of conservatism and the ability to determine the suitability of chiropractic treatment.
doc56	12	Results
doc56	13	In all, 359 of 536 (67%) students responded to the questionnaire.
doc56	14	They generally recognized a number of contra-indications and indications to treatment.
doc56	15	However, they found it more difficult to identify non-indications.
doc56	16	The more conservative students were more likely to intend to treat their patients, even if this was irrelevant (non-indications).
doc56	17	For example, those who were most conservative (group 4) were much more willing than those in group 1 to treat 'chiropractically' a 5-year-old child with no history of back pain or disease to prevent future back pain (OR = 14.7) and also to prevent non-musculoskeletal disease (OR = 22).
doc56	18	Conclusion
doc56	19	It is concerning that students who adhere to the subluxation model are prepared to 'operationalize' their conservative opinions in their future scope of practice; apparently willing to treat asymptomatic people with chiropractic adjustments.
doc56	20	The determinants of this phenomenon need to be understood.
doc57	1	Localization, fate and interactions of Emilin-1 in human skin.
doc57	2	OBJECTIVE
doc57	3	Emilin-1 is a versatile protein abundant in tissues where resilience and elastic recoil are prominent and interacting with components of the extracellular matrix.
doc57	4	Still, little is known about Emilin-1 in the skin.
doc57	5	Therefore, we investigated Emilin-1 in the skin, its localization, its fate upon ageing, its interactions with other proteins and the effect of its knockdown.
doc57	6	METHODS
doc57	7	Skin explants from young or old Caucasian women, immunofluorescently labelled by anti-Emilin-1, anti-Fibrillin-1 and anti-Elastin antibodies, were analysed using confocal microscopy.
doc57	8	Skin explants subjected to UV-induced skin ageing were also analysed.
doc57	9	Colocalization of Emilin-1 with Collagen IV, Fibrillin-1 and Elastin was studied by multiphoton microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation.
doc57	10	Finally, the effect of Emilin-1 extinction was studied by producing small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown fibroblasts and by analysing the outcome on selected genes.
doc57	11	RESULTS
doc57	12	In skin sections from young donors, Emilin-1 localizes similarly to Elastin and Fibrillin-1.
doc57	13	In the papillary dermis, it shows clear and ramified structures, perpendicular to the dermo-epidermal junction that are reminiscent of the oxytalan fibres.
doc57	14	In the reticular dermis, Emilin-1 signal appears identical to that of the elastic fibres network.
doc57	15	Upon intrinsic or UV-induced ageing, the signal associated with Emilin-1 is drastically reduced and disorganized.
doc57	16	Multiphoton microscopy study shows that, as expected, Emilin-1 colocalizes with Elastin.
doc57	17	It also colocalizes with Collagen IV in the basement membrane and within dermal fibroblasts.
doc57	18	Interaction of Emilin-1 with Elastin and Collagen IV was also found by co-immunoprecipitation.
doc57	19	It also reveals interaction with Laminin-5.
doc57	20	Finally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of EMILIN-1 show little effect on the expression level of the 61 genes we studied.
doc57	21	The most striking change is a downregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 that show a decrease similar to that of EMILIN-1 itself and after 8 days a downregulation of COL6A1.
doc57	22	CONCLUSION
doc57	23	In skin, Emilin-1 locates in the dermis, up to the basement membrane, interacting with components of the extracellular matrix but also with the anchoring complex.
doc57	24	These interactions are important for cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and would suggest that Emilin-1 might be important for maintaining the 3D structure of the extracellular matrix.
doc58	1	Observing home-visit quality with the home visit rating scales: Introduction to the special section.
doc58	2	Evidence-based home-visiting programs aim to address one of the most important challenges facing our species-setting the next generation on a healthy path of development that prepares them for a future that is simultaneously uncertain and promising.
doc58	3	Diverse research literatures have pointed to practices to effectively meet this challenge and better achieve the unfulfilled promise of home visiting by more effectively engaging parents in supporting their children's early development and well-being.
doc58	4	Measures of home-visit quality practices drawn from social work, pediatric nursing, early childhood, and early intervention research literatures have identified building relationships with families and focusing on their strengths as effective, practices that are particularly important for vulnerable families.
doc58	5	The articles in this special section used the Home Visit Rating Scales to examine stability in home-visit quality over time, study specific home-visiting processes linked with quality, validate a supervisor checklist of home-visiting implementation, and consider the home visit in relation to an array of indicators reflecting overall home-visiting program strength and stability.
doc58	6	These articles exemplify progress in home-visiting research over recent decades, including advances in direct observational methods and measurement as well as examinations of home visiting as an observable process across various home-visiting program models and populations.
doc59	1	Does oxidized zirconium make a difference? Midterm cohort survivorship of symmetric posterior condyle posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty
doc59	2	Midterm cohort survivorship of symmetric posterior condyle posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty
doc59	3	Background
doc59	4	A novel symmetric posterior condylar design and option of a femoral component with an outer zirconium oxide layer were introduced to a successful asymmetric condylar total knee arthroplasty system in 2005.
doc59	5	Given the paucity of information on this modified design, we performed a study to determine its early to midterm survivorship and performance.
doc59	6	Methods
doc59	7	Patients who received the Genesis II Symmetric Posterior Condyle or Legion Primary total knee (cobalt–chromium [CoCr] or oxidized zirconium–niobium [OxZr]) (Smith & Nephew) implanted at the study centre between March 2007 and December 2013 were enrolled into a prospective database.
doc59	8	We retrospectively reviewed the database and performed survival analysis using Kaplan–Meier techniques.
doc59	9	Results
doc59	10	There were 2178 patients (1359 women [62.4%]; mean age 64.6 yr; mean body mass index 35.0) with 2815 knee replacements available for analysis.
doc59	11	Survival rates were 98.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.6%–98.7%) for failure for any reason at 2 years and 96.8% (95% CI 96.0%–97.7%) at 5 years.
doc59	12	Age (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.997) and female sex (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27–0.75) were protective, whereas body mass index (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99–1.05) and OxZr implant (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.57–2.18) did not influence survivorship.
doc59	13	Oxford Knee Score values improved from a mean of 40.2 to 21.8 by 2 years (p < 0.001), with no difference between the CoCr and OxZr groups.
doc59	14	Conclusion
doc59	15	The symmetric posterior condylar posterior-stabilized knee offers excellent midterm survivorship.
doc59	16	Implant bearing surface did not have an influence on survivorship to 5 years, and, thus, use of OxZr implants may not be justified.
doc60	1	Genetic Analysis of a Large Family with Migraine, Vertigo, and Motion Sickness.
doc60	2	Background
doc60	3	Migraine is a common disorder most typically presenting as headache and often associated with vertigo and motion sickness.
doc60	4	It is a genetically complex condition with multiple genes ultimately contributing to the predisposition and development of this episodic neurological disorder.
doc60	5	We identified a large American family of 29 individuals of which 17 members suffered from at least one of these disorders, migraine, vertigo, or motion sickness.
doc60	6	Many of these individuals suffered from several simultaneously.
doc60	7	We hypothesized that vertigo and motion sickness may involve genes that are independent to those directly contributing to migraine susceptibility.
doc60	8	Methods
doc60	9	Genome-wide linkage analysis performed using 400 microsatellite repeat markers spaced at 10 cM throughout the genome.
doc60	10	The members of this family were phenotyped for each condition, migraine, vertigo, and motion sickness and analyzed separately.
doc60	11	Statistical analysis was performed using two-point and multipoint linkage analysis employing a number of models including autosomal recessive or dominant patterns of inheritance with high and low genetic penetrance.
doc60	12	RESULTS
doc60	13	We identified a novel locus for migraine, 9q13-q22 (maximum two-point logarithm of odds [LOD] score-2.51).
doc60	14	In addition, there are suggestive LOD scores that localize to different chromosomes for each phenotype; vertigo (chromosome 18, LOD score of 1.82) and motion sickness (chromosome 4, LOD score of 2.09).
doc60	15	CONCLUSIONS
doc60	16	Our analysis supports our hypothesis that the migraine-associated vertigo and motion sickness may involve distinct susceptibility genes.
doc61	1	Treatment for human visceral leishmaniasis: a cost-effectiveness analysis for Brazil.
doc61	2	OBJECTIVE
doc61	3	To estimate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for the treatment of VL in Brazil.
doc61	4	METHODS
doc61	5	Cost-effectiveness study comparing three therapeutic options: meglumine antimoniate (MA), liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) and a combination of LAMB plus MA (LAMB plus MA), from public health system and societal perspectives.
doc61	6	An analytical decision-making model was used to compare strategies for the following outcomes: early therapeutic failure avoided at 30 days, days of hospitalisation avoided and VL cure at 180 days.
doc61	7	The efficacy and safety parameters of the drugs came from a randomised, open-label trial and the cost data came from a cost-of-illness study, both carried out in Brazil.
doc61	8	RESULTS
doc61	9	For all outcomes analysed, the LAMB strategy was more effective.
doc61	10	The MA strategy was inferior to the LAMB plus MA strategy for the outcomes early therapeutic failure avoided and cure.
doc61	11	When only LAMB and MA were compared from a societal perspective, a cost of US$ 278.56 was estimated for each additional early therapeutic failure avoided, a cost of US$ 26.88 for each additional day of hospitalisation avoided and a cost of US$ 89.88 for each additional case of cured VL, for the LAMB strategy vs. MA.
doc61	12	CONCLUSION
doc61	13	In Brazil, the LAMB strategy proved to be cost-effective for treating VL, considering a GDP per capita as the willingness-to-pay threshold, for all of the outcomes analysed in comparison to MA.
doc62	1	Against the Current: Wilder Penfield, the Frontal Lobes and Psychosurgery.
doc62	2	Psychosurgery refers to the surgical interruption of the white matter fibres joining the frontal cortex to the remainder of the cortical mantle and to the thalamus, in an attempt to mitigate the manifestations of psychosis.
doc62	3	It reached its heyday following World War Two and was abandoned with the introduction of major tranquilisers such as chlorpromazine.
doc62	4	Wilder Penfield, unlike most of his contemporaries, had a jaundiced view of psychosurgery.
doc62	5	This paper addresses Penfield's early experience with experimental, penetrating brain trauma and with the surgical resection of frontal, epileptogenic lesions, which explain his antagonism towards psychosurgery.
doc63	1	Relationship between reproductive management practices and fertility in primiparous and multiparous dairy cows.
doc63	2	The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of reproductive management practices on fertility in primiparous and multiparous dairy cows and to identify the differences by parity.
doc63	3	Data on reproductive performance and management of cows were gathered from 34 large commercial Holstein-Friesian dairy herds in Hungary.
doc63	4	Individual data on 23 781 cows that calved in the studied herds in 2014 were collected from the national milk recording database and used to calculate the reproductive indices.
doc63	5	 Farm managers and veterinarians were interviewed in person from May 22 to November 6, 2015 using a questionnaire to collect information about reproductive management practices.
doc63	6	The data were statistically analyzed by mixed-effects models.
doc63	7	 Our results showed that the use of a voluntary waiting period (VWP) was linked to a greater increase in calving-to-conception interval (CCI, P < 0.05) and a greater decline in the chance of pregnancy at 200 days in milk (P200, P < 0.001) in multiparous cows.
doc63	8	Estrus synchronization was related to a larger reduction in days-to-first service (DFS, P < 0.001), breeding interval (IBI, P < 0.05), and CCI (P < 0.01) and a greater improvement in P200 (P < 0.001) in primiparous cows.
doc63	9	Early pregnancy diagnosis and pregnancy recheck improved IBI (P < 0.01 for both practices), CCI (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively), and P200 (P < 0.001 for both practices) to a larger extent in primiparous than in multiparous cows.
doc63	10	In conclusion, estrus synchronization, early pregnancy diagnosis, and pregnancy recheck led to a greater improvement in fertility in primiparous cows than in multiparous cows.
doc64	1	Morphometric characteristics of feminine eyebrows: variations with ethnicities and age.
doc64	2	OBJECTIVE
doc64	3	To explore some morphological features of the eyebrows of women of different ethnicities and ages.
doc64	4	MATERIALS AND METHODS
doc64	5	Standard digital photographs of 3600 women of six ethnicities, aged 18-84 years, previously used to describe the morphology of the human eyes, allowed us to focus on their eyebrows, as supplementary and opportunistic study.
doc64	6	Photographs of both eyebrows were analysed partly by manual markings and automatically by dedicated algorithms.
doc64	7	Six parameters of the eyebrows were recorded: length, waviness/curvature, oblique aspect, size (vertical height), total surface and hair coverage (density).
doc64	8	RESULTS
doc64	9	Most criteria present ethnic specificities.
doc64	10	These are: length (longer eyebrows of Indian, shorter among African women); waviness where the straighter eyebrows were found among Chinese and Japanese women.
doc64	11	In general, the longer the eyebrows, the higher their waviness and vice versa.
doc64	12	Thickness (or height) of the eyebrows presents a wide ethnic variability as well as hair coverage, where African women present the lower hair density, inversely to Indian women.
doc64	13	The same holds true with regard to the total surface of eyebrows, of a large variability (by about four times).
doc64	14	Some criteria appear more individually dependent than ethnic-specific, such as the oblique positioning, at the exception of Indian women with less oblique eyebrows.
doc64	15	In all subjects, the criteria of both eyebrows (Left vs. Right) were found to be highly correlated (r > 0.7, P < 0.001).
doc64	16	CONCLUSION
doc64	17	The present investigation brings new findings on a scarcely studied facial element, the morphologic features of which are, for most, ethnic-dependent.
doc64	18	As applied consequences, the results of the present work pave the road to better adapt adorning procedures of the eyebrows vis-à-vis ethnic and age specificities.
doc65	1	Synchronized in vivo measurements of skin hydration and trans-epidermal water loss.
doc65	2	Exploring their mutual influences.
doc65	3	OBJECTIVE
doc65	4	To explore the relationship between skin surface hydration and Trans-Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) when simultaneously measured.
doc65	5	METHODS
doc65	6	Six circular skin areas of the forearms (3 per forearm, 3 cm in diameter) of 12 Caucasian women were used as models.
doc65	7	4 prototypes of formulae of different compositions containing glycerol at different concentrations 7%, 10% and 40% were used as models of hydrating products.
doc65	8	One formula (glycerol-free) was used as control vehicle.
doc65	9	Standardized applications of formulae (2 mg/cm2 ) were performed on 5 skin sites chosen at random, the other being left as bare/control.
doc65	10	A recently marketed instrumental device that records the skin surface hydration and TEWL on a small skin area in a simultaneous manner was used.
doc65	11	Measurements were carried out at T0 (pre-application), at 1 h (T1) and 5 h (T5) post applications on two close sites within the 6 defined areas of both forearms.
doc65	12	RESULTS
doc65	13	The new instrumental device allowed to clearly differentiate the 5 formulae (i.e. 7% vs. 10%) with regard the dose effect brought by glycerol (7%, 10%, 40%) and to record their lingering effects at T1 and T5.
doc65	14	Both parameters were found significantly and negatively correlated, i.e. the higher the skin hydration, the lower the TEWL.
doc65	15	The 40% concentration of glycerol, that leads to the highest skin hydration, brings a drop in the TEWL by about a two-fold factor.
doc65	16	Skin hydration of bare skin and control/vehicle sites showed minor and non-significant changes along 5 h.
doc65	17	Instead, the control/ vehicle slowed down the TEWL to a slight extent.
doc65	18	CONCLUSION
doc65	19	The use of this new instrumental device shed a new light on the mutual and inverse relationships between skin hydration and TEWL.
doc65	20	Results suggest that, at high concentration, glycerol leads to largely increase the water content of both epidermal and dermal compartments, possibly leading to structural changes in the skin relief.
doc66	1	The impact of a new hepatopancreatobiliary surgery program on the management of pancreatic cancer at Health Sciences North
doc66	2	Background
doc66	3	Centralization of specialist services to urban centres presents a challenge to patients living in rural communities.
doc66	4	The hepatopancreatobiliary surgery (HPB) program at Health Sciences North (HSN) is the tenth and newest HPB centre by Cancer Care Ontario and presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the barriers to delivering HPB cancer care to patients in northern Ontario.
doc66	5	Methods
doc66	6	We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients referred to the Northeastern Ontario Cancer Centre and HSN with a pancreatic cancer diagnosis between 2009 and 2015.
doc66	7	July 2013 marked the inception of the HPB surgical program.
doc66	8	Our primary outcome was time to HPB surgical consultation.
doc66	9	Secondary outcomes included distance of travel and time to curative intent operation.
doc66	10	Results
doc66	11	Our population consisted of 207 patients (98 pre-HPB v. 109 post-HPB).
doc66	12	Median time to consultation with an HPB surgeon was decreased in the post-HPB group (43 v. 11 d, p < 0.001).
doc66	13	An increased proportion of patients with pancreatic malignancies in the post-HPB group received HPB surgical consultations (34% v. 74%, p < 0.001), with decreased median distance travelled to surgical consultation (411 v. 79 km, p < 0.001).
doc66	14	Time to curative intent operation or medical oncology consultation did not significantly increase.
doc66	15	Conclusion
doc66	16	A new HPB program appears to have facilitated the proportion of patients with pancreatic malignancies at HSN receiving an HPB surgical consultation.
doc66	17	Patients received complex surgeries, closer to their home regions.
doc66	18	It is anticipated that these changes may affect overall outcomes and patient satisfaction and will be the focus of future investigations.
doc67	1	Importance of authorship and inappropriate authorship assignment in paediatric research in low- and middle-income countries.
doc67	2	OBJECTIVE
doc67	3	To understand the importance of authorship and authorship position, and gauge perceptions of inappropriate authorship assignment, among authors publishing paediatric research conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
doc67	4	METHODS
doc67	5	We conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-methods study using an online survey of both corresponding and randomly selected, non-corresponding authors who published research conducted in LMICs from 2006 to 2015 in the top four paediatric journals by Eigenfactor score.
doc67	6	We used chi-square tests to compare responses by authors living in LMICs to authors living in high-income countries (HICs).
doc67	7	We analysed qualitative responses using thematic analysis.
doc67	8	RESULTS
doc67	9	Of 1420 potential respondents, 19.6% (n = 279) completed the survey.
doc67	10	57% (n = 159) lived in LMICs and 43% (n = 120) in HICs.
doc67	11	LMIC authors more commonly perceived first authorship as most important for their academic advancement than HIC authors (74.2% vs. 60.8%, P = 0.017), while HIC authors reported last authorship as most important (25.1% vs. 38.3%, P = 0.018).
doc67	12	65% (n = 181) of respondents believed that their collaborators had been inappropriately assigned authorship positions (no difference in LMIC and HIC responses) and 32.6% (n = 91) reported personally accepting inappropriate authorship positions (more common in HIC respondents, P = 0.005).
doc67	13	In qualitative data, respondents questioned the applicability of standard authorship guidelines for collaborative research conducted in LMICs.
doc67	14	CONCLUSIONS
doc67	15	LMIC and HIC authors held different perceptions about the importance of authorship position.
doc67	16	Reported inappropriate authorship assignment was common among both LMIC and HIC respondents.
doc67	17	Alternatives to standard authorship criteria for research conducted in LMICs merit further studies.
doc68	1	Maternal depression and infant attachment security: A meta-analysis.
doc68	2	The purpose of this study is to clarify the magnitude of the association between maternal depression and infant attachment nonsecurity, and to identify possible moderators of this relationship.
doc68	3	An extensive literature search was conducted using multiple databases of both published and unpublished studies.
doc68	4	A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment security and to establish the effect size.
doc68	5	The main findings from this meta-analysis, which included 42 studies, indicate that there is a small, yet significant, relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment nonsecurity.
doc68	6	The rate of nonsecurity in infants of mothers with depression was approximately 20% higher than expected rates in a nonclinical population, and the association between depressive symptoms and nonsecurity was small, but significant.
doc68	7	Infants of mothers with depression were nearly twice as likely to have a nonsecure attachment than were infants of healthy mothers.
doc68	8	Depression measure and maternal sample source were identified as significant moderators of the odds ratio effect size.
doc68	9	Results of this study demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment nonsecurity, and suggest that interventions that focus on both maternal mental health and the attachment relationship are warranted.
doc69	1	Pediatric Pharmacy Services in Canadian Adult Hospitals: An Inventory and Prioritization of Services.
doc69	2	Background
doc69	3	The rate of potential adverse drug events is reported to be 3 times higher among pediatric inpatients than among their adult counterparts.
doc69	4	Various methods have been suggested to reduce medication errors in pediatric patients.
doc69	5	One of the most influential of these strategies is inclusion of a clinical pharmacist on the multidisciplinary care team.
doc69	6	However, there is currently no literature describing the inventory of pharmacy services provided to pediatric patients in Canadian adult hospitals.
doc69	7	Objectives
doc69	8	The primary objective of this study was to describe pediatric and neonatal pharmacy services provided in adult hospitals in Canada.
doc69	9	The secondary objective was to determine whether the services provided correspond to services that pharmacists working in Canadian pediatric hospitals identified as important for adult hospitals that provide pediatric services.
doc69	10	Methods
doc69	11	Two web-based surveys were created, focusing on 35 pharmacy services.
doc69	12	The first survey was intended for adult hospitals, and the second for pediatric hospitals.
doc69	13	The surveys were distributed by e-mail and were completed in January and February 2018.
doc69	14	Results
doc69	15	A total of 55 and 43 valid responses were received from respondents in adult hospitals and pediatric hospitals, respectively.
doc69	16	An inventory of pharmacy services provided by adult hospitals to their pediatric and neonatal patients was obtained.
doc69	17	Of the adult hospitals that responded, 61% (33/54) had pharmacists assigned to pediatric or neonatal units.
doc69	18	The frequency with which most pharmacy services were provided was comparable to the importance identified by pharmacists working in pediatric hospitals.
doc69	19	However, for the provision of education during admission and at discharge and for the provision of medication reconciliation at discharge, frequency and importance were not comparable.
doc69	20	Conclusions
doc69	21	Adult hospitals with a pharmacist assigned to an inpatient pediatric or neonatal clinical area met most expectations of pharmacists working in pediatric hospitals in terms of pharmacy services provided.
doc69	22	However, some services require optimization for this patient population.
doc70	1	Position Statement on the Use of Medical Cannabis for the Treatment of Epilepsy in Canada.
doc70	2	In Canada, recreational use of cannabis was legalized in October 2018.
doc70	3	This policy change along with recent publications evaluating the efficacy of cannabis for the medical treatment of epilepsy and media awareness about its use have increased the public interest about this agent.
doc70	4	The Canadian League Against Epilepsy Medical Therapeutics Committee, along with a multidisciplinary group of experts and Canadian Epilepsy Alliance representatives, has developed a position statement about the use of medical cannabis for epilepsy.
doc70	5	This article addresses the current Canadian legal framework, recent publications about its efficacy and safety profile, and our understanding of the clinical issues that should be considered when contemplating cannabis use for medical purposes.
doc71	1	Community engagement to manage acute malnutrition: implementation research in Kupang district, Indonesia.
doc71	2	Objective
doc71	3	To improve the low coverage and performance of a programme on community-based management of acute malnutrition, implemented between October 2015 and April 2018 in Kupang district in rural Indonesia.
doc71	4	Methods
doc71	5	To investigate why the coverage and performance were low in the first year of the programme, we conducted a semiquantitative evaluation between August and September 2016.
doc71	6	We used the results from the evaluation to inform programme improvement, by developing and modifying community mobilization strategies.
doc71	7	We employed a multipronged approach to improve community awareness on acute malnutrition and on community-based services for such condition.
doc71	8	This approach involved workshops, focus discussion groups in the community and sensitization events at health posts that had issues with community engagement.
doc71	9	Community health workers increased their efforts in active case finding by visiting households with children who had missed the community health post sessions.
doc71	10	We measured the performance using three Sphere minimum standard performance indicators: proportion of children recovering (> 75%); defaulting (< 15%); and dying (<10%).
doc71	11	Results
doc71	12	The community mobilization efforts increased the screening rate from 17% (564/3278) in October 2015 to 66% (6793/10 251) in March 2018.
doc71	13	In 2017, the programme met the three performance indicators: 79% (256/326) of children recovered; 10% (34/326) defaulted; and less than 1% (2/326) died.
doc71	14	Conclusion
doc71	15	In Indonesia, community mobilization is central for addressing severe acute malnutrition in children younger than five years.
doc71	16	This strategy includes securing political leadership and effective messaging alongside locally tailored strategies and continuous ground-level support.
doc72	1	Evaluation of immune protection against Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice induced by a multi-antigenic DNA vaccine containing TgGRA24, TgGRA25 and TgMIC6.
doc72	2	Toxoplasma gondii infection is prevalent in humans and animals worldwide.
doc72	3	In this study, recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmids (pVAX-GRA24, pVAX-GRA25 and pVAX-MIC6) were constructed, and then injected into Kunming mice intramuscularly, as cocktailed plasmids or as single-gene plasmids.
doc72	4	We evaluated immune protective responses by detecting the titer of antibodies and cytokine production of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23, the percentages of the subclasses of T lymphocytes, as well as the records of the survival time and cyst decrement in the brain of the mouse model after challenge with the T. gondii RH and Pru strains, respectively.
doc72	5	Compared with the control groups, antibody and cytokine production were significantly increased, while the survival times of mice in all immunized groups were also prolonged, and the number of T. gondii cysts in their brains were decreased significantly (29.03% for pVAX-GRA24; 40.88% for pVAX-GRA25; 37.70% for pVAX-MIC6; 48.06% for pVAX-GRA24 + pVAX-GRA25; and 55.37% for pVAX-GRA24 + pVAX-GRA25 + pVAX-MIC6).
doc72	6	The mouse group immunized with the three-gene cocktail (TgGRA24 + TgGRA25 + TgMIC6) had better performance in each detection index than the mouse groups immunized with the two-gene cocktail of TgGRA24 + TgGRA25, which was better than that in the group immunized with the single gene vaccine of TgGRA24, TgMIC6 or TgGRA25.
doc72	7	In conclusion, TgGRA24 or TgGRA25 may be good vaccine candidates against T. gondii infection, but the three-gene cocktail of TgGRA24, TgMIC6 and TgGRA25 may induce the strongest protective immunity.
doc72	8	Further studies of multi-antigenic DNA vaccines or cocktailed vaccines against T. gondii infection are necessary.
doc73	1	An environmental scan of quality improvement and patient safety activities in emergency medicine in Canada.
doc73	2	OBJECTIVE
doc73	3	We conducted an environmental scan of quality improvement and patient safety (QIPS) infrastructure and activities in academic emergency medicine (EM) programs and departments across Canada.
doc73	4	METHODS
doc73	5	We developed 2 electronic surveys through expert panel consensus to assess important themes identified by the CAEP QIPS Committee.
doc73	6	"Survey 1"" was sent by email to all 17 Canadian medical school affiliated EM department Chairs and Academic Hospitals department Chiefs; ""Survey 2"" to 12 identified QIPS leads in these hospitals. "
doc73	7	This was followed by 2 monthly email reminders to participate in the survey.
doc73	8	RESULTS
doc73	9	22/70 (31.4%) Department Chairs/Chiefs completed Survey 1.
doc73	10	Most (81.8%) reported formal positions dedicated to QIPS activities within their groups, with a mixed funding model.
doc73	11	Less than half of these positions have dedicated logistical support.
doc73	12	11/12 (91.7%) local QIPS leads completed Survey 2.
doc73	13	Two-thirds (63.6%) reported explicit QIPS topics within residency curricula, but only 9.1% described QIPS training for staff physicians.
doc73	14	Many described successful academic scholarship output, with the total number of peer-reviewed QIPS-related publications per centre ranging from 1-10 over the past 5 years.
doc73	15	Few respondents reported access to academic supports: methodologists (27.3%), administrative personnel (27.3%), and statisticians (9.1%).
doc73	16	CONCLUSION
doc73	17	This environmental scan provides a snapshot of QIPS activities in EM across academic centres in Canada.
doc73	18	We found significant local educational and academic efforts, although there is a discrepancy between the level of formal support/infrastructure and such activities.
doc73	19	There remains opportunity to further advance QIPS efforts on a national level, as well as advocating and supporting local QIPS activities.
doc74	1	Multipotentiality of skin-derived precursors: application to the regeneration of skin and other tissues.
doc74	2	Skin-derived precursors (SKPs) have been described as multipotent dermal precursors.
doc74	3	Here, we provide a review of the breadth and depth of scientific literature and studies regarding SKPs, accounting for a large number of scientific publications.
doc74	4	Interestingly, these progenitors can be isolated from embryonic and adult skin, as well as from a population of dermal cells cultured in vitro in monolayer.
doc74	5	Gathering information from different authors, this review explores different aspects of the SKP theme, such as the potential distinct origins of SKPs in rodents and in humans, and also their ability to differentiate in vitro and in vivo into multiple lineages of different progeny.
doc74	6	This remarkable capacity makes SKPs an interesting endogenous source of precursors to explore in the framework of experimental and therapeutic applications in different domains.
doc74	7	SKPs are not only involved in the skin's dermal maintenance and support as well as wound healing, but also in hair follicle morphogenesis.
doc74	8	This review points out the interests of future researches on SKPs for innovative perspectives that may be helpful in many different types of scientific and medical domains.
doc75	1	Nutritional, clinical and immunological status of children at HIV diagnosis in the continental region of Equatorial Guinea.
doc75	2	OBJECTIVE
doc75	3	To evaluate the nutritional, clinical and immunological status of children at HIV diagnosis in the continental region of Equatorial Guinea.
doc75	4	METHODS
doc75	5	Children <18 years diagnosed with HIV between 2009 and 2017 were included.
doc75	6	Clinical, immunological and nutritional data were collected.
doc75	7	Weight-for-height, weight-for-age and height-for-age Z-scores were calculated using WHO Child Growth Standards.
doc75	8	The population was assessed in two equal periods (2009-2013 and 2014-2017) from the time of diagnosis.
doc75	9	RESULTS
doc75	10	A total of 213 children were diagnosed with HIV (49.3% males), median age 3.8 years (IQR: 1.5-8.2).
doc75	11	A total of 121 cases (56.8%) were at WHO clinical stage III, and 53 (24.9%) were at WHO clinical stage IV.
doc75	12	CDC immunological stage II was diagnosed in 51/130 (39.2%) and CDC stage III in 44/130 (33.8%).
doc75	13	About 56.2% of children were underweight (weight-for-age <-2 SD); 20.1% moderately and 36.1% severely so.
doc75	14	About 27.6% of children were wasted (weight-for-height <-2 SD); 11.9% moderately and 15.7% severely so.
doc75	15	About 56.3% of children were stunted (height-for-age <-2 SD); 20.7% moderately and 35.6% severely so.
doc75	16	The prevalence of wasting was higher in children ≤5 years than in children >5 years (36.4% vs. 19.1%, P = 0.026).
doc75	17	In the second period, the prevalence of moderate-severe immunodeficiency decreased (87.2% to 67.0%, P = 0.018), without significant differences in the other nutritional or clinical data.
doc75	18	Severe underweight was a risk factor for moderate-severe immunodeficiency (aOR: 4 [95% CI: 1.4-11.4], P = 0.010).
doc75	19	CONCLUSIONS
doc75	20	We highlight a high proportion of malnutrition at the time of HIV diagnosis in Guinea´s paediatric population.
doc75	21	Early diagnosis of HIV infection is a priority, achievable by training Guinea´s physicians to suspect HIV early, introducing HIV molecular diagnostic techniques and ensuring intensive nutritional treatment.
doc76	1	HIV self-testing services for female sex workers, Malawi and Zimbabwe.
doc76	2	Objective
doc76	3	To present findings from implementation and scale-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) self-testing programmes for female sex workers in Malawi and Zimbabwe, 2013-2018.
doc76	4	Methods
doc76	5	In Zimbabwe, we carried out formative research to assess the acceptability and accuracy of HIV self-testing.
doc76	6	During implementation we evaluated sex workers' preferences for, and feasibility of, distribution of test kits before the programme was scaled-up.
doc76	7	In Malawi, we conducted a rapid ethnographic assessment to explore the context and needs of female sex workers and resources available, leading to a workshop to define the distribution approach for test kits.
doc76	8	Once distribution was implemented, we conducted a process evaluation and established a system for monitoring social harm.
doc76	9	Findings
doc76	10	In Zimbabwe, female sex workers were able to accurately self-test.
doc76	11	The preference study helped to refine systems for national scale-up through existing services for female sex workers.
doc76	12	The qualitative data helped to identify additional distribution strategies and mediate potential social harm to women.
doc76	13	In Malawi, peer distribution of test kits was the preferred strategy.
doc76	14	We identified some incidents of social harm among peer distributors and female sex workers, as well as supply-side barriers to implementation which hindered uptake of testing.
doc76	15	Conclusion
doc76	16	Involving female sex workers in planning and ongoing implementation of HIV self-testing is essential, along with strategies to mitigate potential harm.
doc76	17	Optimal strategies for distribution and post-test support are context-specific and need to consider existing support for female sex workers and levels of trust and cohesion within their communities.
doc77	1	Implementation of a Clinical Decision Support Tool to Improve Antibiotic IV-to-Oral Conversion Rates at a Community Academic Hospital.
doc77	2	Background
doc77	3	Antibiotic IV-to-oral (IV-PO) conversion is a key initiative of antimicrobial stewardship programs.
doc77	4	Guidelines and education are commonly described interventions to promote IV-PO conversion; however, technological interventions may be more effective in changing practice.
doc77	5	Objective
doc77	6	To determine the impact of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool on the adoption and sustainability of an antibiotic IV-PO conversion program at a community academic hospital.
doc77	7	Methods
doc77	8	A quasi-experimental study consisting of 3 phases was conducted.
doc77	9	During phase 1, the pre-intervention antibiotic IV-PO conversion rate was determined.
doc77	10	During phase 2, the IV-PO conversion policy was updated, education was provided to pharmacists and physicians, and a post-intervention evaluation was conducted.
doc77	11	During phase 3, a CDS tool was developed to generate real-time electronic alerts prompting pharmacists to assess antibiotic therapy, and post-intervention audits were performed 1 month, 3 months, and 15 months after implementation of the tool.
doc77	12	Pantoprazole IV-PO conversion was assessed during each phase as a non-equivalent dependent variable.
doc77	13	The primary outcome was the proportion of patients eligible for IV-PO conversion who were switched to oral therapy.
doc77	14	Results
doc77	15	Of 332 patients receiving targeted IV antibiotic therapy during the overall study period, 122 (37%) met the criteria for IV-PO conversion.
doc77	16	The phase 2 IV-PO conversion rate of 35% (9/26) was comparable to the pre-intervention rate of 29% (10/35) (p = 0.61). Implementation of the CDS tool significantly increased the conversion rate to 78% (14/18), an increase that was sustained at 3 months (71% [17/24]) and 15 months (74% [14/19]) after implementation (p < 0.05 for all comparisons with phases 1 and 2).
doc77	17	Pantoprazole conversion rates were similar across all phases.
doc77	18	Conclusions
doc77	19	Implementation of the CDS tool was effective in improving and sustaining antibiotic IV-PO conversion rates and enhancing policy compliance beyond the effects of policy revision and education.
doc77	20	Refinement of both the policy and the tool is warranted to maximize adoption of the IV-PO conversion program.
doc78	1	The aquatic animal pandemic crisis.
doc78	2	The growth of aquaculture over the past 50 years has been accompanied by the emergence of aquatic animal diseases, many of which have spread to become pandemic in countries or continents.
doc78	3	An analysis of 400 emerging disease events in aquatic animals that were logged by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science between 2002 and 2017 revealed that more than half were caused by viruses.
doc78	4	However, in molluscs, most events were parasitic.
doc78	5	Categorising these events indicated that the key processes underpinning emergence were the movement of live animals and host switching.
doc78	6	Profiles of key pathogens further illustrate the importance of wild aquatic animals as the source of new infections in farmed animals.
doc78	7	It is also clear that the spread of new diseases through the largescale movement of aquatic animals for farming, for food and for the ornamental trade has allowed many to achieve pandemic status.
doc78	8	Many viral pathogens of fish (e.g. infectious salmon anaemia, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia) and shrimp (e.g. white spot syndrome virus) affect a large proportion of the global production of key susceptible species.
doc78	9	Wild aquatic animal populations have also been severely affected by pandemic diseases, best exemplified by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a fungal infection of amphibians, whose emergence and spread were driven by the movement of animals for the ornamental trade.
doc78	10	Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is now widespread in the tropics and subtropics and has caused local extinctions of susceptible amphibian hosts.
doc78	11	Given the rising demand for seafood, aquacultural production will continue to grow and diseases will continue to emerge.
doc78	12	Some will inevitably achieve pandemic status, having significant impacts on production and trade, unless there are considerable changes in global monitoring and the response to aquatic animal diseases.
doc79	1	Antioxidative enzyme activity and total antioxidant capacity in serum of dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease.
doc79	2	This study was designed to evaluate the antioxidative status of serum by measuring its total antioxidant capacity, as well as the antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase), in dogs with various stages of degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) compared to healthy controls.
doc79	3	In total, 71 client-owned dogs in different stages of DMVD, which included healthy controls, took part in the study.
doc79	4	Following an anamnesis, clinical examination, standard transthoracic echocardiograpic examination, chest X-ray, complete blood (cell) count, and serum biochemistry, dogs were divided into 2 study groups.
doc79	5	Blood was drawn from each dog once at the time of presentation and selected antioxidant parameters were measured using commercially available assay kits.
doc79	6	The activity of superoxide dismutase gradually decreased in the more advanced stages of DMVD, while the activity of catalase was significantly higher in the group of dogs with asymptomatic DMVD compared to healthy controls and dogs with symptomatic DMVD.
doc79	7	No significant changes were noted in total antioxidant capacity and the activity of glutathione reductase.
doc79	8	Results suggested that DMVD has a significant impact on the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the serum of the tested dogs.
doc79	9	Knowledge of changes in the activity of antioxidative enzymes may warrant further studies, possibly to evaluate the potential role of compounds with antioxidative properties in the clinical outcome of dogs with DMVD.
doc80	1	On the relationship between the sense of self and the structure of dreams examined through questionnaire research for Japanese university students.
doc80	3	 In this paper, the author attempts to show some structural changes in the adolescent mind in modern Japan through examination of our quantitative research of the dreams of university students. Two questionnaires, Scale of Anthropophobia Mentality and Scale of Sense of Self, were administered while asking students about the contents of their 'impressive dreams' in childhood as well as their recent dreams.
doc80	4	By paying attention to the relationship between the sense of self of dream-ego and the structure of dreams, the author demonstrates the subjects' difficulty, or inability, to 'have' anxiety and thereby become active enough both on the surface of their consciousness and in the depth of their unconscious to effect change in their situation.
doc80	5	The author concludes with a suggestion regarding the necessity of a cross-cultural study in this field and adds some points of comparison between German and Japanese dreams reported in psychotherapies.
doc81	1	New records of spirurid nematodes (Nematoda, Spirurida, Guyanemidae, Philometridae & Cystidicolidae) from marine fishes off New Caledonia, with redescriptions of two species and erection of Ichthyofilaroides n. gen.
doc81	2	Recent examinations of spirurid nematodes (Spirurida) from deep-sea or coral reef marine fishes off New Caledonia, collected in the years 2006-2009, revealed the presence of the following five species: Ichthyofilaroides novaecaledoniensis (Moravec et Justine, 2009) n. gen., n. comb. (transferred from Ichthyofilaria Yamaguti, 1935) (females) (Guyanemidae) from the deep-sea fish Hoplichthys citrinus (Hoplichthyidae, Scorpaeniformes), Philometra sp. (male fourth-stage larva and mature female) (Philometridae) from Epinephelus maculatus (Serranidae, Perciformes), Ascarophis (Dentiascarophis) adioryx Machida, 1981 (female) (Cystidicolidae) from Sargocentron spiniferum (Holocentridae, Beryciformes), Ascarophis (Ascarophis) nasonis Machida, 1981 (males and females) from Naso lituratus and N. unicornis (Acanthuridae, Perciformes), and Ascarophisnema tridentatum Moravec et Justine, 2010 (female) from Gymnocranius grandoculis (Lethrinidae, Perciformes).
doc81	5	Two species, I. novaecaledoniensis and A. nasonis, are redescribed based on light microscopical (LM) and scanning electron microscopical (SEM) examinations, the latter used in these species for the first time.
doc81	6	Morphological data on the specimen of A. tridentatum from the new host species are provided.
doc81	7	Philometra sp. (from E. maculatus) most probably represents a new gonad-infecting species of this genus.
doc81	8	The newly established genus Ichthyofilaroides n. gen. is characterized mainly by the presence of a small buccal capsule and by the number and distribution of cephalic papillae in the female; it is the sixth genus in the Guyanemidae.
doc82	1	Ibuprofen for the prevention of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.
doc82	2	BACKGROUND
doc82	3	Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicates the clinical course of preterm infants and increases the risk of adverse outcomes.
doc82	4	Indomethacin has been the standard treatment to close a PDA but is associated with renal, gastrointestinal, and cerebral side effects.
doc82	5	Ibuprofen has less effect on blood flow velocity to important organs.
doc82	6	OBJECTIVES
doc82	7	Primary objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to placebo/no intervention, or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs in the prevention of PDA in preterm infants.
doc82	8	SEARCH METHODS
doc82	9	We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 17 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 17 October 2018), and CINAHL; 1982 to 17 October 2018).
doc82	10	We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.
doc82	11	SELECTION CRITERIA
doc82	12	Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ibuprofen with placebo/no intervention or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.
doc82	13	DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
doc82	14	We extracted outcomes data including presence of PDA on day three or four of life (after 72 hours of treatment), need for surgical ligation or rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, mortality, cerebral, renal, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal complications.
doc82	15	We performed meta-analyses and reported treatment estimates as typical mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and, if statistically significant, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or to harm (NNTH), along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed between-study heterogeneity by the I-squared test (I²).
doc82	16	We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.
doc82	17	MAIN RESULTS
doc82	19	In this updated analysis, we included nine trials (N = 1070 infants) comparing prophylactic ibuprofen (IV or oral) with placebo/no intervention or indomethacin.
doc82	20	Ibuprofen (IV or oral) probably decreases the risk of PDA on day 3 or 4 (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.48; typical RD -0.26, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.21; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; 9 trials; N = 1029) (moderate-quality evidence). In the control group, the spontaneous closure rate was 58% by day 3 to 4 of age.
doc82	21	In addition, ibuprofen probably decreases the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (typical RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.26; typical RD -0.27, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.22; NNTB 4; 95% CI 3 to 5),and the need for surgical ductal ligation (typical RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.00; NNTB 33, 95% CI 20 to infinity; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). There was a possible decrease in the risk of grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) in infants receiving prophylactic ibuprofen (typical RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; I² = 34%; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to- 0.00; I² = 60%; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). High quality evidence showed increased risk for oliguria (typical RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.02; typical RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; NNTH 17, 95% CI 9 to 100; 4 trials; N = 747).
doc82	22	Low quality results from four studies (N = 202) showed that administering oral ibuprofen may decrease the risk of PDA (typical RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74) and may increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (NNTH 7, 95% CI 4 to 25).
doc82	23	No evidence of a difference was identified for mortality, any intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), or chronic lung disease.
doc82	24	AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
doc82	25	This review shows that prophylactic use of ibuprofen, compared to placebo or no intervention, probably decreases the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, and for surgical ductal closure.
doc82	26	Adverse effects associated with ibuprofen (IV or oral) included increased risks for oliguria, increase in serum creatinine levels, and increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
doc82	27	There was a reduced risk for intraventricular haemorrhage (grade III - IV) but no evidence of a difference in mortality, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, or time to reach full feeds.
doc82	28	In the control group, the patent ductus arteriosus had closed spontaneously by day 3 or 4 in 58% of neonates.
doc82	29	Prophylactic treatment exposes a large proportion of infants unnecessarily to a drug that has important side effects without conferring any important short-term benefits.
doc82	30	Current evidence does not support the use of ibuprofen for prevention of patent ductus arteriosus.
doc82	31	Until long-term follow-up results of the trials included in this review have been published, no further trials of prophylactic ibuprofen are recommended.
doc82	32	A new approach to patent ductus arteriosus management is an early targeted treatment based on echocardiographic criteria within the first 72 hours of life, that have a high sensitivity for diagnosing a patent ductus arteriosus that is unlikely to close spontaneously.
doc82	33	Such trials are currently ongoing in many parts of the world.
doc82	34	"Results of such trials will be included in updates of our ""Ibuprofen for treatment of PDA"" review."
doc83	1	Estimation of GFR in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis: A Cross-Sectional Study.
doc83	2	Background
doc83	3	Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have frequent infectious complications requiring nephrotoxic medications, necessitating monitoring of renal function.
doc83	4	Although adult studies have suggested that cystatin C (CysC)-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may be preferable due to reduced muscle mass of patients with CF, pediatric patients remain understudied.
doc83	5	Objective
doc83	6	Our objective was to determine which eGFR formula is best for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in pediatric patients with CF.
doc83	7	Methods
doc83	8	A total of 17 patients with CF treated with nephrotoxic antibiotics were recruited from the Children's Hospital at London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.
doc83	9	99Tc DTPA GFR (measured GFR [mGFR]) was measured with 4-point measurements starting at 120 minutes using a 2-compartmental model with Brøchner-Mortensen correction, with simultaneous measurement of creatinine, urea, and CysC.
doc83	10	The eGFR was calculated using 16 known equations based on creatinine, urea, CysC, or combinations of these.
doc83	11	Primary outcome measures were correlation with mGFR, and agreement within 10% for various eGFR equations.
doc83	12	Results
doc83	13	Mean mGFR was 136 ± 21 mL/min/1.73 m2.
doc83	14	Mean creatinine, CysC, and urea were 38 ± 10 μmol/L, 0.72 ± 0.08 mg/L, and 3.9 ± 1.4 mmol/L, respectively.
doc83	15	The 2014 Grubb CysC eGFR had the best correlation coefficient (r = 0.75, P = .0004); however, only 35% were within 10%.
doc83	16	The new Schwartz formula with creatinine and urea had the best agreement within 10%, but a relatively low correlation coefficient (r = 0.63, P = .0065, 64% within 10%).
doc83	17	Conclusions
doc83	18	Our study suggests that none of the eGFR formulae work well in this small cohort of pediatric patients with CF with preserved body composition, possibly due to inflammation causing false elevations of CysC. Based on the small numbers, we cannot conclude which eGFR formula is best.
doc84	1	Polyaxial stress-dependent permeability of a three-dimensional fractured rock layer.
doc84	2	A study about the influence of polyaxial (true-triaxial) stresses on the permeability of a three-dimensional (3D) fractured rock layer is presented.
doc84	3	"The 3D fracture system is constructed by extruding a two-dimensional (2D) outcrop pattern of a limestone bed that exhibits a ladder structure consisting of a ""through-going"" joint set abutted by later-stage short fractures."
doc84	4	Geomechanical behaviour of the 3D fractured rock in response to in-situ stresses is modelled by the finite-discrete element method, which can capture the deformation of matrix blocks, variation of stress fields, reactivation of pre-existing rough fractures and propagation of new cracks.
doc84	5	A series of numerical simulations is designed to load the fractured rock using various polyaxial in-situ stresses and the stress-dependent flow properties are further calculated.
doc84	6	The fractured layer tends to exhibit stronger flow localisation and higher equivalent permeability as the far-field stress ratio is increased and the stress field is rotated such that fractures are preferentially oriented for shearing.
doc84	7	The shear dilation of pre-existing fractures has dominant effects on flow localisation in the system, while the propagation of new fractures has minor impacts.
doc84	8	The role of the overburden stress suggests that the conventional 2D analysis that neglects the effect of the out-of-plane stress (perpendicular to the bedding interface) may provide indicative approximations but not fully capture the polyaxial stress-dependent fracture network behaviour.
doc84	9	The results of this study have important implications for understanding the heterogeneous flow of geological fluids (e.g. groundwater, petroleum) in subsurface and upscaling permeability for large-scale assessments.
doc85	1	Blackleg without skeletal muscle involvement as a cause of sudden death in unvaccinated calves.
doc85	2	Nine, 5-month-old unvaccinated black Angus calves died in less than 48 hours of each other.
doc85	3	The calves expressed minimal or no clinical signs prior to death.
doc85	4	On-farm post-mortem examinations were carried out on 3 of the deceased calves, and findings included: necrotizing and fibrinosuppurative myositis of the diaphragm muscle, and fibrinosuppurative pleuritis and epicarditis.
doc85	5	Fluorescent antibody testing for pathogenic clostridia identified Clostridium chauvoei and a diagnosis of blackleg was made.
doc85	6	The remainder of the herd were then vaccinated.
doc86	1	Outcomes of decentralizing hypertension care from district hospitals to health centers in Rwanda, 2013-2014.
doc86	2	Setting
doc86	3	Three district hospitals (DHs) and seven health centers (HCs) in rural Rwanda.
doc86	4	Objective
doc86	5	To describe follow-up and treatment outcomes in stage 1 and 2 hypertension patients receiving care at HCs closer to home in comparison to patients receiving care at DHs further from home.
doc86	6	Design
doc86	7	A retrospective descriptive cohort study using routinely collected data involving adult patients aged ⩾18 years in care at chronic non-communicable disease clinics and receiving treatment for hypertension at DH and HC between 1 January 2013 and 30 June 2014.
doc86	8	Results
doc86	9	Of 162 patients included in the analysis, 36.4% were from HCs.
doc86	10	Patients at DHs travelled significantly further to receive care (10.4 km vs. 2.9 km for HCs, P < 0.01).
doc86	11	Odds of being retained were significantly lower among DH patients when not adjusting for distance (OR 0.11, P = 0.01).
doc86	12	The retention effect was consistent but no longer significant when adjusting for distance (OR 0.18, P = 0.10).
doc86	13	For those retained, there was no significant difference in achieving blood pressure targets between the DHs and HCs.
doc86	14	Conclusion
doc86	15	By removing the distance barrier, decentralizing hypertension management to HCs may improve long-term patient retention and could provide similar hypertension outcomes as DHs.
doc87	1	Mobile targeted screening for tuberculosis in Zimbabwe: diagnosis, linkage to care and treatment outcomes.
doc87	2	Setting
doc87	3	Targeted active screening for tuberculosis (Tas4TB) using mobile trucks in the community was implemented in 15 high TB burden districts in Zimbabwe.
doc87	4	At-risk populations were screened for TB based on symptoms and chest radiography (CXR) results.
doc87	5	Those with any positive symptom and/or an abnormal CXR had sputum collected for investigation and diagnosis and were linked to care and treatment if found to have TB.
doc87	6	Objective
doc87	7	To determine 1) the proportion and characteristics of those screened and diagnosed with TB; 2) the relationship between TB symptoms, CXR and diagnostic yields; and 3) the relationship between initiation of anti-TB treatment and treatment outcomes.
doc87	8	Design
doc87	9	Cohort study using routinely collected data.
doc87	10	Results
doc87	11	A total of 39 065 persons were screened, of whom 663 (1.7%) were diagnosed with TB; 126/663 (19.0%) were bacteriologically confirmed.
doc87	12	The highest TB diagnostic yields were in symptomatic persons with CXRs suggestive of TB (19.4%), asymptomatic persons with CXRs suggestive of TB (8.4%) and persons at high-risk of TB (3.2%).
doc87	13	For all diagnosed TB patients, pre-treatment loss to follow-up was 18.9% and treatment success was 59.9%.
doc87	14	Conclusion
doc87	15	Tas4TB resulted in high diagnostic yields; however, linkage of diagnosis to care was poor.
doc87	16	Reasons for loss to follow-up need to be better understood and rectified.
doc88	1	Evidence from the Lebanon Global School-based Student Health Survey on midwakh tobacco smoking in school students: a harbinger of the next global tobacco pandemic?
doc88	2	Background
doc88	3	Cigarette smoking is the most common form of tobacco consumption but other methods have grown in popularity.
doc88	4	In the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries, smoking dokha, a form of tobacco mixed with herbs and spices in a midwakh pipe, is common.
doc88	5	Aims
doc88	6	The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of midwakh use in school students in Lebanon and factors associated with its use.
doc88	7	Methods
doc88	8	Data on tobacco use from the Lebanon Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS), 2017 were analysed, including current midwakh use (defined as midwakh use at least once in the 30 days before the survey).
doc88	9	The survey includes school students in grades 7-12 (12-18 years).
doc88	10	Current midwakh use was analysed according to sociodemographic and tobacco-related variables using bivariate and logistic regression analyses.
doc88	11	Results
doc88	12	Of the 5590 students included in the analysis, 4.6% were current midwakh users.
doc88	13	Current midwakh use was significantly more prevalent in students 13 years and older and in male students (P < 0.01).
doc88	14	Current use was also statistically significantly more prevalent in students in public than private schools.
doc88	15	Current cigarette smoking (OR = 15.22; 95% CI: 11.08-20.90), ever use of a waterpipe (OR = 9.61; 95% CI: 6.66-13.86) and parental smoking (OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.05-2.31) were also significantly associated with current midwakh use.
doc88	16	Conclusion
doc88	17	Although midwakh use is low in Lebanon, the patterns of association of midwakh use are similar to those of cigarette and waterpipe smoking in young people.
doc88	18	Further research is needed to understand the context of midwakh use and prevent it from spreading.
doc89	1	Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Canadian Patients Diagnosed With Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome.
doc89	2	Background
doc89	3	Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is an extremely rare, heterogeneous disease of uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway that is difficult to diagnose.
doc89	4	We have evaluated the Canadian patients enrolled in the Global aHUS Registry to provide a Canadian perspective regarding the diagnosis and management of aHUS and the specific challenges faced.
doc89	5	Objective
doc89	6	To evaluate Canadian patients enrolled in the Global aHUS Registry to provide a Canadian perspective regarding the diagnosis and management of aHUS and the specific challenges faced.
doc89	7	Methods
doc89	8	The Global aHUS Registry is an observational, noninterventional, multicenter study that has prospectively and retrospectively collected data from patients of all ages with an investigator-made clinical diagnosis of aHUS, irrespective of treatment.
doc89	9	Patients of all ages with a clinical diagnosis of aHUS were eligible and invited for enrollment, and those with evidence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection, or with ADAMTS13 activity ≤10%, or a subsequent diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were excluded.
doc89	10	Data were collected at enrollment and every 6 months thereafter and were analyzed descriptively for categorical and continuous variables.
doc89	11	End-stage renal disease (ESRD)-free survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and ESRD-associated risk factors of interest were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
doc89	12	Patients were censored at start of eculizumab for any outcome measures.
doc89	13	Results
doc89	14	A total of 37 Canadian patients were enrolled (15 pediatric and 22 adult patients) between February 2014 and May 2017; the median age at initial aHUS presentation was 25.9 (interquartile range = 6.7-51.7) years; 62.2% were female and 94.6% had no family history of aHUS.
doc89	15	Over three-quarters of patients (78.4%) had no conclusive genetic or anti-complement factor H (CFH) antibody information available, and most patients (94%) had no reported precipitating factors prior to aHUS diagnosis.
doc89	16	Nine patients (8 adults and 1 child) experienced ESRD prior to the study.
doc89	17	After initial presentation, there appears to be a trend that children are less likely to experience ESRD than adults, with 5-year ESRD-free survival of 93 and 56% (P = .05) in children and adults, respectively.
doc89	18	Enrolling physicians reported renal manifestations in all patients at initial presentation, and 68.4% of patients during the chronic phase (study entry ≥6 months after initial presentation).
doc89	19	Likewise, extrarenal manifestations also occurred in more patients during the initial presenting phase than the chronic phase, particularly for gastrointestinal (61.1% vs 15.8%) and central nervous system sites (38.9% vs 5.3%).
doc89	20	Fewer children than adults experienced gastrointestinal manifestations (50.0% vs 70.0%), but more children than adults experienced pulmonary manifestations (37.5% vs 10.0%).
doc89	21	Conclusions
doc89	22	This evaluation provides insight into the diagnosis and management of aHUS in Canadian patients and the challenges faced.
doc89	23	More genetic or anti-CFH antibody testing is needed to improve the diagnosis of aHUS, and the management of children and adults needs to consider several factors such as the risk of progression to ESRD is based on age (more likely in adults), and that the location of extrarenal manifestations differs in children and adults.
doc90	1	Cerebral palsy in Canada, 2011-2031: results of a microsimulation modelling study of epidemiological and cost impacts.
doc90	2	INTRODUCTION
doc90	3	The objective of our study was to present model-based estimates and projections on current and future health and economic impacts of cerebral palsy in Canada over a 20-year time horizon (2011-2031).
doc90	4	METHODS
doc90	5	We used Statistics Canada's Population Health Model (POHEM)-Neurological to simulate individuals' disease states, risk factors and health determinants and to describe and project health outcomes, including disease incidence, prevalence, life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy, health-related quality of life and health care costs over the life cycle of Canadians.
doc90	6	Cerebral palsy cases were identified from British Columbia's health administrative data sources.
doc90	7	A population-based cohort was then used to generate the incidence and mortality rates, enabling the projection of future incidence and mortality rates.
doc90	8	A utility-based measure (Health Utilities Index Mark 3) was also included in the model to reflect various states of functional health to allow projections of health-related quality of life.
doc90	9	Finally, we estimated caregiving parameters and health care costs from Canadian national surveys and health administrative data and included them as model parameters to assess the health and economic impact of cerebral palsy.
doc90	10	RESULTS
doc90	11	Although the overall crude incidence rate of cerebral palsy is projected to remain stable, newly diagnosed cases of cerebral palsy will rise from approximately 1800 in 2011 to nearly 2200 in 2031.
doc90	12	In addition, the number of people with the condition is expected to increase from more than 75 000 in 2011 to more than 94 000 in 2031.
doc90	13	Direct health care costs in constant 2010 Canadian dollars were about $11 700 for children with cerebral palsy aged 1-4 years versus about $600 for those without the condition.
doc90	14	In addition, people with cerebral palsy tend to have longer periods in poorer health-related quality of life.
doc90	15	CONCLUSION
doc90	16	Individuals with cerebral palsy will continue to face challenges related to an ongoing need for specialized medical care and a rising need for supportive services.
doc90	17	Our study offers important insights into future costs and impacts associated with cerebral palsy and provides valuable information that could be used to develop targeted health programs and strategies for Canadians living with this condition.
doc91	1	Venous thromboembolism in emergency general surgery patients: a single-centre retrospective cohort study
doc91	2	Background
doc91	3	There is limited literature on the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients.
doc91	4	We undertook this study to identify the rate of symptomatic VTE for patients undergoing EGS operations.
doc91	5	Methods
doc91	6	We conducted a retrospective cohort study evaluating EGS patients who underwent operative intervention between March and December 2014.
doc91	7	Data collected included patient demographics, type of procedure, risk of VTE, VTE prophylaxis, development of symptomatic VTE, and mortality.
doc91	8	Results
doc91	9	We included 767 patients in our analysis.
doc91	10	The mean age was 53 ± 19.7 years, and 52.2% of patients were female.
doc91	11	Eighteen patients (2.3%) experienced VTE in hospital and 12 (1.6%) experienced VTE after discharge.
doc91	12	Only 66% of patients received appropriate VTE prophylaxis.
doc91	13	High-risk patients had a higher VTE rate (7.4% v. 2.3%, p < 0.001) and higher mortality (17.6% v. 4.0%, p < 0.001) than lowto moderate-risk patients.
doc91	14	Conclusion
doc91	15	The risk of VTE in patients requiring EGS is significant and persists after hospital discharge.
doc91	16	Further studies on quality improvement with VTE prophylaxis are warranted.
doc92	1	Rebleeding in Variceal and Nonvariceal Gastrointestinal Bleeds in Cirrhotic Patients Using Vitamin K1: The LIVER-K Study.
doc92	2	Background
doc92	3	Gastroesophageal varices are the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in patients with cirrhosis.
doc92	4	Vitamin K1 is commonly administered to patients presenting with UGIB and elevated international normalized ratio, despite limited evidence to support this practice.
doc92	5	Objectives
doc92	6	The primary objective was to describe the incidence of rebleeding within 30 days after vitamin K1 administration in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.
doc92	7	The secondary objective was to describe prescribing patterns for vitamin K1.
doc92	8	Methods
doc92	9	This retrospective, descriptive multicentre study involved patients with cirrhosis and UGIB who were admitted to any of the 4 adult acute care hospitals in Calgary, Alberta, from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016.
doc92	10	Patients were divided into 2 groups: those who received vitamin K1 and those who did not.
doc92	11	Results
doc92	12	A total of 370 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 243 received vitamin K1 and 127 did not.
doc92	13	Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups.
doc92	14	Greater proportions of patients in the vitamin K1 group received transfusions of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, or prothrombin concentrate during their admissions.
doc92	15	There was no significant difference in the duration of octreotide and pantoprazole infusions.
doc92	16	Among patients in the vitamin K1 group, there were more admissions to the intensive care unit and longer lengths of stay.
doc92	17	More patients in the no vitamin K1 group had esophageal varices evident on endoscopy that required endoscopic treatment.
doc92	18	Forty of the patients (16.5%) in the vitamin K1 group and 7 (5.5%) in the no vitamin K1 group had rebleeding within 30 days of the initial bleed.
doc92	19	The median total vitamin K1 dose administered was 25 mg.
doc92	20	Conclusions
doc92	21	The study results suggest that vitamin K1 does not reduce the incidence of rebleeding within 30 days of the initial bleed in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.
doc93	1	Drainage Collection After Endoscopic-Assisted Transaxillary Dual-Plane Augmentation Mammaplasty Using Cold or Electrosurgical Separation of Interpectoral Space.
doc93	2	Background
doc93	3	Endoscopic transaxillary augmentation mammaplasty breast augmentation offers several advantages over other augmentation methods.
doc93	4	Nonetheless, this procedure is fraught with some problems, including greater surgical trauma due to the longer separation area.
doc93	5	We hypothesized that cold separation of the interpectoral space could reduce surgical injury in comparison to the electrosurgical method.
doc93	6	This study aimed to compare the outcomes of endoscopic-assisted transaxillary augmentation mammaplasty using cold separation versus electrosurgical separation of the interpectoral space.
doc93	7	Methods
doc93	8	In this prospective clinical trial, cold and electrosurgical separation of the interpectoral space were achieved using a separation shovel and monopolar electrotome, respectively.
doc93	9	A total of 20 patients who visited our department in Beijing, China, for primary breast augmentation surgeries from October 1, 2017, and May 31, 2018, were included.
doc93	10	The primary outcome was total postoperative drainage volume.
doc93	11	The secondary outcomes were operative time, daily drainage volume, daily pain as assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS), and reoperation rate.
doc93	12	Quantitative data were compared using independent-samples t test.
doc93	13	Chi-square test was used to compare 2 classified indexes.
doc93	14	Results
doc93	15	The total drainage volume was significantly lower in the cold separation group than in the electrosurgical separation group (170.45 ± 75.40 mL vs 281.05 ± 148.43 mL; P = .005).
doc93	16	The VAS score on the first postoperative day was significantly lower in the cold separation group than in the electrosurgical separation group (6.45 ± 1.93 vs 7.55 ± 1.43; P = .048).
doc93	17	Two (20%) reoperations owing to postoperative pain or implant stiffness were performed in the electrosurgical separation group.
doc93	18	Conclusions
doc93	19	Cold separation is more conducive to reducing drainage, relieving postoperative pain, and causing less damage than the electrosurgical method in endoscopic-assisted transaxillary dual-plane augmentation mammaplasty.
doc94	1	Gun-carrying restrictions and gun-related mortality, Colombia: a difference-in-difference design with fixed effects.
doc94	2	Objective
doc94	3	To assess the effect of a permanent gun-carrying restriction on gun-related mortality in Colombia between 2008 and 2014, and determine differences in the effect of the restriction by place of death and sex.
doc94	4	Methods
doc94	5	In 2012, Bogotá and Medellín introduced a permanent gun-carrying restriction.
doc94	6	We compared gun-related mortality rates in these cities (intervention cities) with the rates in all other Colombian cities with more than 500 000 inhabitants (control cities).
doc94	7	We used data from the Colombian National Department of Statistics to calculate monthly gun-related mortality rates between 2008 and 2014 for intervention and control cities.
doc94	8	We used a differences-in-differences method with fixed effects to assess differences in gun-related mortality in intervention and control cities before and after the introduction of the gun-carrying restriction.
doc94	9	We stratified effects by place of death (public area or residence) and sex.
doc94	10	We made robustness checks to test the assumptions of the models.
doc94	11	Findings
doc94	12	Gun-related deaths in the control and intervention cities decreased between 2008 and 2014; however, the decrease was greater in the intervention cities (from 20.29 to 14.93 per 100 000 population; 26.4%) than in the control cities (from 37.88 to 34.56 per 100 000 population; 8.8%).
doc94	13	The restriction led to a 22.3% reduction in the monthly gun-related mortality rate in Bogotá and Medellín.
doc94	14	The reduction was greater in public areas and for males.
doc94	15	Robustness checks supported the assumptions of the models.
doc94	16	Conclusion
doc94	17	The permanent restriction on carrying guns reduced gun-related deaths.
doc94	18	This policy could be used to reduce gun-related injuries in urban centres of other countries with large numbers of gun-related deaths.
doc95	1	Prevalence and clinical characteristics of diabetes mellitus in Lebanon: a national survey.
doc95	2	Background
doc95	3	Diabetes mellitus in all its forms has been rapidly increasing worldwide, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
doc95	4	Aims
doc95	5	This national study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical aspects of diabetes mellitus in Lebanon with special focus on type 1 (T1DM).
doc95	6	Methods
doc95	7	A national multistage, random household sample survey was conducted, using face-to-face interviews with 1 questionnaire per household.
doc95	8	A total of 4500 households were selected from all areas based on a pre-existing sampling frame of the Lebanese population.
doc95	9	Results
doc95	10	The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus in the surveyed population of 17 832 persons (mean age ~36 years) was 7.95%.
doc95	11	The prevalence of T1DM in particular was estimated at 0.1%, or almost 1% of all detected cases of diabetes mellitus.
doc95	12	Most persons with diabetes mellitus reported obtaining their usual care from endocrinologists rather than primary healthcare physicians.
doc95	13	Delayed performance of haemoglobin A1c test was reported in 25% of 1418 patients.
doc95	14	Hypoglycaemic episodes recently occurred in 30% of patients; of whom, at least one third required medical attention, including hospital admission.
doc95	15	Diagnosed complications were reported in 22% of cases, with retinopathy being the most common.
doc95	16	Conclusions
doc95	17	Prevalence of T1DM in this population was lower than international estimates.
doc95	18	Diabetes mellitus management appears to be deficient, based on delays in standard control testing, hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetes mellitus-related complications.
doc95	19	Coordination of diabetic care management should be devolved to primary healthcare physicians, who can keep track of the need for referral to various types of diabetes mellitus care.
doc96	1	Hand hygiene initiative: comparative study of pre- and postintervention outcomes.
doc96	2	Background
doc96	3	Adequate hand hygiene is considered the most effective measure to reduce transmission of nosocomial pathogens.
doc96	4	Aims
doc96	5	To determine the effectiveness of infection control intervention to improve compliance with hand hygiene in the Emergency Department, Al-Leith General Hospital, Saudi Arabia, and evaluate bacterial load on hands as a possible indicator of improvement.
doc96	6	Methods
doc96	7	The study consisted of 3 phases: Phase I, measurement of basal hand hygiene compliance level; Phase II, multimodal hand hygiene educational programme was initiated; and Phase III, hand hygiene compliance level was measured again.
doc96	8	"Data were collected by direct observation of healthcare workers in the emergency department between October 2016 and March 2017, using the standardized World Health Organization method for direct observation, ""Five Moments for Hand Hygiene"".
doc96	9	The intervention comprised health education sessions using direct personal contact."
doc96	10	Hands of healthcare workers were sampled during Phases I and III by sterile bag method, and bacterial load was determined.
doc96	11	Results
doc96	12	A total of 1374 opportunities for hand hygiene were observed during the triphase study.
doc96	13	Implementation of the interventional hand hygiene educational programme significantly improved compliance with hand hygiene guidelines from 30.7% to 45.5% (P < 0.01).
doc96	14	Log10 bacterial load per hand dropped from 4.97 (standard deviation = 0.32) to 4.57 (0.47) (P < 0.05).
doc96	15	Conclusions
doc96	16	Hand hygiene educational programmes were effective in improving compliance in the emergency department, and bacterial load on hands of healthcare workers could be used as an indicator of improvement in hand hygiene compliance.
doc97	1	Utilization and Costs of Noninvasive Cardiac Tests After Acute Coronary Syndromes: Insights From the Alberta COAPT Study.
doc97	2	Background
doc97	3	Although appropriate noninvasive cardiac tests (NICTs) after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) provide useful prognostic information, inappropriate use leads to inefficient expenditure of existing healthcare resources.
doc97	4	By using the Alberta Contemporary Acute Coronary Syndrome Patient Invasive Treatment Strategies (COAPT) Registry, we evaluated the use and costs of NICTs among patients discharged within 1 year after ACS.
doc97	5	Methods
doc97	6	All patients discharged from the hospital with a primary diagnosis of ACS in Alberta between 2004/2005 and 2015/2016 were included.
doc97	7	Frequency of NICTs (stress tests [± imaging] and nonstress imaging tests) was determined from linked provincial databases.
doc97	8	Costs were obtained from the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan Medical Procedure List.
doc97	9	Results
doc97	10	Of 55,516 patients with ACS, 30,760 had at least 1 NICT (55.4%), with 13,505 (24.3%) having > 1 NICT performed within 1 year.
doc97	11	Temporal trends of NICT increased over time (stress tests: P trend < 0.001; nonstress imaging tests: P trend < 0.001).
doc97	12	NICT most commonly occurred within the first 4 months after hospital discharge (stress tests at 2 months; nonstress imaging tests at 3-4 months).
doc97	13	In 2015/2016, the total estimated costs of NICT were $1.35M, a 22.4% increase from 2004/2005 (1.10M) (P < 0.001), whereas a decrease in incidence of ACS over the same time period was noted (P = 0.008).
doc97	14	Conclusions
doc97	15	Rates of NICT 1 year after ACS are high and increasing over time.
doc97	16	Estimated costs of NICT appear to be escalating out of proportion to the ACS growth.
doc97	17	Further investigation is warranted because it is speculative whether the increase in NICT and costs results in clinical benefit after ACS.
doc98	1	A Risk Management Strategy for Managing Critical Human Resource Changes in a Pediatric Heart Program.
doc98	2	Background
doc98	3	Relocation, recruitment, or retirement of critical team members may lead to changes in the expertise pool that could threaten patient outcomes in a pediatric heart program.
doc98	4	We developed a quality initiative aimed at risk management that uses risk-stratified case complexity and outcomes to guide a program during critical fluxes in the expert staff.
doc98	5	The Ramp Down/Up protocol is a systematic, voluntary reduction in the complexity of cases performed, followed by a transparent and intentional escalation of case complexity.
doc98	6	Methods
doc98	7	Institutional Ethics Review Board approval for this quality initiative was obtained.
doc98	8	Patient/caregiver consent for quality data collection is obtained at the time of hospital admission.
doc98	9	Every surgical patient having their index cardiac surgical procedure at the Izaak Walton Killam (IWK) from January 1, 2003, to December 2015 is included.
doc98	10	The Ramp Down/Up protocol evolved to have to 4 critical elements: (1) a trigger and a reduction in case complexity; (2) an external/objective expert observer; (3) an escalation in case complexity; and (4) data (qualitative and quantitative) collection and analysis.
doc98	11	Results
doc98	12	The Ramp Down/Up protocol was used 3 times over a 12-year period to address critical expert human resource challenges.
doc98	13	The protocol was used for variable duration (3.5-9 months).
doc98	14	Patient operative mortality was benchmarked to the Congenital Cardiac Surgery database, and outcomes were stable during and after protocol employment.
doc98	15	Conclusions
doc98	16	A quality initiative aimed at risk management has allowed 1 pediatric heart team to ensure that patient outcomes were maintained during critical human resource changes.
doc99	1	Stroke and Systemic Thromboembolism Prevention in People Living With Human Immunodeficiency Virus With Atrial Fibrillation: A Review of Its Implications for Clinical Practice.
doc99	2	In the last few decades, types of diseases affecting people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) have shifted as the population ages, with cardiovascular disease becoming a leading cause of death in this population.
doc99	3	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly common arrhythmia both in the general population and in PLHIV, with an estimated prevalence of 2% to 3% among PLHIV.
doc99	4	Prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism (SSE) with antithrombotic therapy is a cornerstone of AF treatment and substantially decreases AF-related morbidity and mortality.
doc99	5	Although updated guidelines extensively discuss this issue, they do not address the peculiarities of PLHIV.
doc99	6	The role of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as an independent factor for SSE in individuals with AF and whether the presence of HIV should alter the threshold for SSE thromboprophylaxis are unknown.
doc99	7	Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence describes the increasing burden of comorbidities such as hypertension and stroke in PLHIV, which predispose them to AF and SSE.
doc99	8	In the absence of HIV-specific AF guidelines, PLHIV with AF should be comprehensively assessed for their risk of SSE and bleeding using commonly available scores despite them having been primarily validated in the non-HIV population.
doc99	9	Both vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants can be used in PLHIV.
doc99	10	Addressing HIV-related comorbidities and potential drug-drug interactions with antiretrovirals is crucial to prevent SSE and reduce adverse reactions of oral anticoagulants.
doc99	11	This review summarizes the current guidelines for SSE prevention in patients with AF and describes key considerations for their implementation among PLHIV receiving antiretroviral therapy.
